# Project Description:

This is the third task for Develop features for **Wiki Loves Monuments App**, aimed at getting you familiar with Wikimedia Commons API.

In this task, I wrote a python function that accepts a file name, and returns a particular information category defined by the function from the file API on the WIkimedia site.

For example, the

        get_dimension(file)

function accepts a file name, accesses the file API on the wikimedia site, then returns the original dimensions(size, height, width) of the file. The file name is usually prefixed with "File:...."

This particular task involves writing six(6) functions that returns the: 
- Primary location
- Country location
- Image dimensions
- Camera model
- Geo-location and
- Date the image was taken.

Each function returns the information in a neatly formatted string type.
